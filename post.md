# Reactive Canvas with Rust/WebAssembly and web-sys

## Or How I learn To Stop Worrying And Love Macros

It's been a little while since I built a resizable dot with a slider in some esoteric stack.  Time for Chapter 3!  I guess it's a series now.

The last two demos used languages that transpile the whole app to regular ol' JavaScript to be interpreted.  This time around, we're going to be compiling our app to WebAssembly first, and then having JavaScript load that.

As per usual with these dot demos, this is overkill for this app.  This one perhaps especially so.  Roll up your sleeves, we're gonna scrob us some DOM.

## The Pipeline

This section is largely copped straight outta the [RustWasm Book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html).  If you plan to do further work with Rust and WebAssembly, head straight there next (or now).  You'll need a Rust toolchain and Node/NPM to follow along.

First, create a new library-type crate:

```
$ cargo new wasm-dot --lib
$ cd wasm-dot
```

We need to add `wasm-bindgen`.  This crate auto-generates all the JS <-> Rust FFI glue for us, and is much of the reason Rust is such a phenomenal choice for writing WebAssembly.  Open up `Cargo.toml` in the crate root and make it look like this:

```toml
[package]
name = "wasm-dot"
description = "Demo canvas wasm app"
license = "MIT"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["You <you@yourcoolsite.you>"]
edition = "2018"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```

The `cdylib` crate type will produce a dynamic system library for loading into another language.  Now open up `src/lib.rs` and make it look like this:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    // import the alert() js function
    pub fn alert(s: &str);
}

// export a Rust function that uses the imported JS function
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn say_hi() {
    alert("Hi from Rust/Wasm!");
}
```

We're importing the JavaScript `alert()` function, and exporting our own `say_hi()` Rust function that calls it.  That's all we need to do, `wasm_bindgen` is taking care of the details.  This will just ensure both directions work as intended.

The rustwasm team also provides a tool called [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) to automateWebAssembly packaging and integration with npm.  You'll need to install it once with `cargo install wasm-pack`, and then you can use it to build your package:

```rust
$ wasm-pack build
[INFO]: Checking for the Wasm target...
[INFO]: Compiling to Wasm...
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.00s
[INFO]: :-) Done in 0.05s
[INFO]: :-) Your wasm pkg is ready to publish at ./pkg.
```

Inside `pkg/`, you'll find everything you need to deploy, ready to be imported into any npm project.  All swe need now is a project in which to use it!  Because the rustwasm group thought of everything, there's a template ready to go - use it to create a new project:

```
$ npm init wasm-app www
```

This folder now contains a webpage with all the machinery set up to load your wasm library and call it from `index.js`:

```js
import * as wasm from "hello-wasm-pack";

wasm.greet();
```

There's a stub included so that it will run as is, but we don't want to import from `hello-wasm-pack`, we want to use the app we're developing.  To point it in the right direction, open up `www/package.json` and add a `dependencies` key, pointing directly at the output dir from `wasm-pack`:

```json
  // ..
  "dependencies": {
    "wasm-dot": "file:../pkg"
  }
```

Now we can point `www/index.js` there:

```js
import * as wasm from "wasm-dot";

wasm.say_hi();
```

Let's see if it does the thing:

```
$ npm install // because we added a dependency
$ npm run start
```

You should see the requested alert:

![hello wasm alert box screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/INNppw6.png)

Huzzah!  Now we can iterate.  I recommend opening a second terminal at this point.  In one, run `npm run start` and keep it open, and in the other invoke `wasm-pack build` whenever you make a change to the Rust.

One thing to keep in mind when programming this way is that the memory you're working with from Rust is wholly separate and distinct from the garbage-collected head that JS is using.  Instead, you're working with a linear tape.  I can't put this any better than [the book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/implementing.html) does:

> As a general rule of thumb, a good JavaScriptâ†”WebAssembly interface design is often one where large, long-lived data structures are implemented as Rust types that live in the WebAssembly linear memory, and are exposed to JavaScript as opaque handles. JavaScript calls exported WebAssembly functions that take these opaque handles, transform their data, perform heavy computations, query the data, and ultimately return a small, copy-able result. By only returning the small result of the computation, we avoid copying and/or serializing everything back and forth between the JavaScript garbage-collected heap and the WebAssembly linear memory.

Before we look at the JavaScript side, let's build the Rust app.  This will contain the slider element, the canvas element, and the logic.

## The Layout

To deal with the JavaScript universe, the `wasm-bindgen` project provides two important crates: `web-sys` provides bindings for all the Web APIS (!!) and `js-sys` provides all the ECMAScript stuff like `Array` and `Date` (!!).  Yeah, they already did the hard work.  It's pretty cool, you don't need to manually define a `Document.createElement` extern or anything.  Instead, just pull in what we need from `web-sys` in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"

[dependencies.web-sys]
version = "0.3"
features = [
    "Attr",
    "CanvasRenderingContext2d",
    "Document",
    "Element",
    "Event",
    "EventTarget",
    "HtmlCanvasElement",
    "HtmlElement",
    "HtmlInputElement",
    "Node",
    "Text",
    "Window"
]
```

It's a huge crate, so each interface is feature-gated.  You only use what you need.  If you're trying to call a function and it's telling you it doesn't exist, double check the API docs.  It always tells you which features a given method needs:

![feature gate screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/thITZh3.png)

To make sure it's all groovy, we're going to build a DOM node ourselves, JS-style but, like, also Rust-style.  Remove the `alert()` test in `src/lib.rs` and add:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() {
    // get window/document/body
    let window = web_sys::window().expect("Could not get window");
    let document = window.document().expect("Could not get document");
    let body = document.body().expect("Could not get body");

    mount_app(&document, &body);
}

fn mount_app(document: &Document, body: &HtmlElement) {
    mount_title(&document, &body);
}

// Create a title
fn mount_title(document: &Document, body: &HtmlElement) {
    // create title element
    let title = document
        .create_element("h1")
        .expect("Could not create element");
    let title_text = document.create_text_node("DOT"); // always succeeds
    title
        .append_child(&title_text)
        .expect("Could not append child to title");

    // append to body
    body.append_child(&title)
        .expect("Could not append title to body");
}
```

Now instead of `say_hi()` we'll need to call `run()` in `www/index.js`:

```js
import * as wasm from "wasm-dot";

wasm.run();
```

See if it works by running `wasm-pack build` and reloading `localhost:8080`:

![dom node screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/7yiqu7f.png)

Whoa.  Did you see how blazing-fast and WASM-infused that title was?!

No, you didn't, but still.  Neat.  Before moving on, let's address the error handling situation.  All of these `web-sys` calls will return a `Result<T, JsValue>`.  We're not going to deal with other types of errors in this tiny demo, so just alias that:

```rust
type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, JsValue>;
```

Now we can how our functions return a `Result<()>` and get to use the `?` operator instead of sprinkling `expect()` everywhere.  Refactor `main()` to leverage this:

```rust
fn get_document() -> Result<Document> {
    let window = web_sys::window().unwrap();
    Ok(window.document().unwrap())
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() -> Result<()> {
    let document = get_document()?;
    let body = document.body().unwrap();

    mount_app(&document, &body)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Pulling `get_document()` out will help us define the event listener later.

First, though, we need to define the DOM tree we want.  Here's what we're aiming for in HTML:

```html
  <div id="rxcanvas">
    <span id="size-output"></span>
    <input id="size" type="range" min="1" max="100" step="5">
    <label for="size">- Size</label>
    <p>
      <canvas id="dot-canvas"></canvas>
    </p>
  </div>
```

If you've ever manipulated the DOM via JavaScript, you're pretty much good to go.  In Rust, though, this is *so verbose*.  Look how big the function to create a simple `<h1>DOT</h1>` element was!  I promised up above there would be macros - here we go.

For the uninitiated, a macro is a bit of code that expands into other Rust code *before* everything is evaluated.  In Rust, they look like function calls but with an exclamation point at the end.  They aren't function calls at all though - when the compiler comes through your module, it expands all of these anywhere they find them into the full Rust code you (or a library) defined.  It's a mechanism for automatic code generation!

This syntax is the only place in Rust you'll see that `macro_rules! thing { () => {} }` bracket pattern.  It's it's own special syntax.  The parameters are prefixed with a `$` and placed in the parens, and are copied in to the Rust code in the curly braces during expansion, right in place in your code.

Rust actually has another type of macro called a [procedural macro](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html) that's *even more powerful and arcane* but for now `macro_rules!` will do us just fine.

Here's a macro to append an arbitrary number of attributes to a DOM element, passed as 2-tuples:

```rust
macro_rules! append_attrs {
    ($document:ident, $el:ident, $( $attr:expr ),* ) => {
        $(
            let attr = $document.create_attribute($attr.0)?;
            attr.set_value($attr.1);
            $el.set_attribute_node(&attr)?;
        )*
    }
}
```

Each parameter to expand is tagged with a token type - and `ident` will allow us to pass a Rust name though and an `expr` takes any Rust expression (in this case, a 2-tuple).  When called, each one will just paste this block of Rust into our function in place, using what we pass in.

This macro is variadic.  The `$( $name:expr ),*` syntax means that it will carry out this block for zero or more arguments given, pasting the block in the curly braces to match.  Each time through, the arg we're processing gets the name `$attr`.

You can call it like this, with as many trailing tuple arguments as needed for each attribute:

```rust
append_attrs!(document, label, ("for", "size"));
```

We can do better, though - macros can call other macros!  We can boil everything down to the bare minimum by defining a few more helpers:

```rust
macro_rules! append_text_child {
    ($document:ident, $el:ident, $text:expr ) => {
        let text = $document.create_text_node($text);
        $el.append_child(&text)?;
    };
}

macro_rules! create_element_attrs {
    ($document:ident, $type:expr, $( $attr:expr ),* ) => {{
        let el = $document.create_element($type)?;
        append_attrs!($document, el, $( $attr ),*);
        el}
    }
}

macro_rules! append_element_attrs {
    ($document:ident, $parent:ident, $type:expr, $( $attr:expr ),* ) => {
        let el = create_element_attrs!($document, $type, $( $attr ),* );
        $parent.append_child(&el)?;
    }
}

macro_rules! append_text_element_attrs {
    ($document:ident, $parent:ident, $type:expr, $text:expr, $( $attr:expr ),*) => {
        let el = create_element_attrs!($document, $type, $( $attr ),* );
        append_text_child!($document, el, $text);
        $parent.append_child(&el)?;
    }
}
```

There are two "top-level" macros, `append_element_attrs` and `append_text_element_attrs`.  The former will append a childless element with the given attributes to the parent provided and the latter will include a text node child.  Note that to pass the variadic trailing arguments down you just use the same syntax inside the curly brace expansion but omit the `expr` type:

```rust
let el = create_element_attrs!($document, $type, $( $attr ),* );
```

Now we can replace the entirety of that `mount_title()` function with a single macro invocation:

```rust
fn mount_app(document: &Document, body: &HtmlElement) -> Result<()> {
    append_text_element_attrs!(document, body, "h1", "DOT",);
    Ok(())
}
```

I've also added our new return type, and as a result we now return a simple `Ok(())` at the end to signify success.  This macro expansion contains `?` operators, which will now work as expected!

Note the trailing comma after `"DOT"` is mandatory - that's the "zero or more" attributes the macro accepts.  That's so much boilerplate we've avoided though.  The initial function is what the compiler sees when building the binary, we just saved ourselves the hassle of typing it all.  Thanks, macros!  Thacros.

Here's the whole f#@%!^g owl:

```rust
fn mount_canvas(document: &Document, parent: &Element) -> Result<()> {
    let p = create_element_attrs!(document, "p",);
    append_element_attrs!(document, p, "canvas", ("id", "dot-canvas"));
    parent.append_child(&p)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn mount_controls(document: &Document, parent: &HtmlElement) -> Result<()> {
    // containing div
    let div = create_element_attrs!(document, "div", ("id", "rxcanvas"));
    // span
    append_text_element_attrs!(
        document,
        div,
        "span",
        &format!("{}", STARTING_SIZE),
        ("id", "size-output")
    );
    // input
    append_element_attrs!(
        document,
        div,
        "input",
        ("id", "size"),
        ("type", "range"),
        ("min", "5"),
        ("max", "100"),
        ("step", "5")
    );
    // label
    append_text_element_attrs!(document, div, "label", "- Size", ("for", "size"));
    // canvas
    mount_canvas(&document, &div)?;
    parent.append_child(&div)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn mount_app(document: &Document, body: &HtmlElement) -> Result<()> {
    append_text_element_attrs!(document, body, "h1", "DOT",);
    mount_controls(&document, &body)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The astute will notice a reference to `STARTING_SIZE` - add that constant to the top of your file, this is where the slider will start when the page renders:

```rust
const STARTING_SIZE: u32 = 50;
```

All the `web_sys` calls look very familiar if you're coming from JavaScript.  If you want a Web API function, just try looking for it in the [`web-sys` API docs](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/).  Each listing will conveniently link to the corresponding MDN page, too!  Leveraging crates or writing your own abstractions to make this smoother is both quite possible and left as an exercise for the reader.

Rebuild with `wasm-pack build`, and if you have `webpack-dev-server` running (via `npm run start`) you can reload `localhost:8080`:

Good stuff.

## The Action

This doesn't do anything, though.  There's nary a dot in sight, let alone a resizable one.  The first order of business is to draw the dot:

```rust
// draw dot
fn update_canvas(document: &Document, size: u32) -> Result<()> {
    // grab canvas
    let canvas = document
        .get_element_by_id("dot-canvas")
        .unwrap()
        .dyn_into::<web_sys::HtmlCanvasElement>()?;
    // resize canvas to size * 2
    let canvas_dim = size * 2;
    canvas.set_width(canvas_dim);
    canvas.set_height(canvas_dim);
    let context = canvas
        .get_context("2d")?
        .unwrap()
        .dyn_into::<web_sys::CanvasRenderingContext2d>()?;

    // draw

    context.clear_rect(0.0, 0.0, canvas.width().into(), canvas.height().into());
    // create shape of radius 'size' around center point (size, size)
    context.begin_path();
    context.arc(
        size.into(),
        size.into(),
        size.into(),
        0.0,
        2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI,
    )?;
    context.fill();
    context.stroke();

    Ok(())
}
```

This is also not too too foreign if you've done this is JavaScript.  One unfamiliar element is those `dyn_into` calls.  To get this working, you need another import at the top of the file:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::JsCast;
```

When you grab an element with `Document::get_element_by_id(%str)` it returns an `Element` type.  A plain element doesn't have a `width` or a `height`, though - this is specifically a `canvas` element.  That object does have these fields, so we can attempt to cast.  If we did indeed grab the correct element, this will succeed so now we can use things like `set_height()` and `get_context()`.  Note that all methods use snake_case instead of camelCase, and you can't directly modify a field with `canvas.height = 10;`, you must use a method: `canvas.set_height(10);`.  Otherwise this is a translation of equivalent JavaScript to resize the canvas to the bounding box of the circle with the given radius and then draw that circle.

Cool.  We'll also need to update the `<span>` we have dedicated to showing the current size:

```rust
// update the size-output span
fn update_span(document: &Document, new_size: u32) -> Result<()> {
    let span = document.get_element_by_id("size-output").unwrap();
    span.set_text_content(Some(&format!("{}", new_size)));
    Ok(())
}
```

This isn't too surprising, `set_text_content` is a setter for [`Node.textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent).  Let's bundle up these two updates:

```rust
// given a new size, sets all relevant DOM elements
fn update_all() -> Result<()> {
    // get new size
    let document = get_document()?;
    let new_size = document
        .get_element_by_id("size")
        .unwrap()
        .dyn_into::<web_sys::HtmlInputElement>()?
        .value()
        .parse::<u32>()
        .expect("Could not parse slider value");
    update_canvas(&document, new_size)?;
    update_span(&document, new_size)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

This is going to be our onChange handler for the slider input, called inside this special FFI-interop-y `Closure`:

```rust
fn attach_listener(document: &Document) -> Result<()> {
    // listen for size change events

    update_all()?; // call once for initial render before any changes

    let callback = Closure::wrap(Box::new(move |_evt: web_sys::Event| {
        update_all().expect("Could not update");
    }) as Box<dyn Fn(_)>);

    document
        .get_element_by_id("size")
        .unwrap()
        .dyn_into::<web_sys::HtmlInputElement>()?
        .set_onchange(Some(callback.as_ref().unchecked_ref()));

    callback.forget(); // leaks memory!

    Ok(())
}
```

This uses a `web_sys::Closure`.  This allows you to pass Rust-defined closures through to JS to be used as event listener callbacks.  This has some definite weirdness, I'm going to direct you to [the book](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/closures.html) for a better run though of why this looks like it does.  That `as_ref().unchecked_ref()` chain lets you extract the `&Function` that `set_onchange` expects from teh `web_sys::Closure`.

Now we just need to call this after we mount the app:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() -> Result<()> {
    let document = get_document()?;
    let body = document.body().unwrap();

    mount_app(&document, &body)?;
    attach_listener(&document)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

And that's it!  Recompile, reload, and rejoice and you resize.  Aww *yisss*.
